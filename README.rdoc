== DESCRIPTION:

The Web Spider Obstacle Course (WSOC) is an example web-site that tests
the thoroughness and resilience of Web Spiders.

== FEATURES:

== SYNOPSIS:

  $ wsoc_server localhost 8080

Then simply point your Web Spider of choice at the following URL:

  http://localhost:8080/course/start.html

For the Web Spider to complete the course, it must spider every link listed
in the +/course/+ directory exactly once. A successfull Web Spider will not
leave the WSOC server nor the +/course/+ directory, while spidering links.

The list of URLs that a Web Spider must visit or ignore can be obtained from
the WSOC server at the following URL, as JSON encoded data:

  http://localhost:8080/specs.json

WSOC also provides a YAML version of the specs, available at the following
URL:

  http://localhost:8080/specs.yaml
